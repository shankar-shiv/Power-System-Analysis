# Power System Analysis

## This project aims to give electrical power engineers a tool to easily calculate power system equations

Power System Equations discussed here are :

1. Gauss Seidel
2. Newton Raphson
3. Reserve Margin
4. Diversity Factor
5. Capacity Factor

Note: Most common algorithms like Gauss-Seidel and Newton Raphson are implemented for practical purposes. This project can be embedded as a library.

-[ ] Make a YT Video explaining Gauss-Seidel and Newton raphson
