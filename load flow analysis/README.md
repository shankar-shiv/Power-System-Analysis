# Load flow

## What is Load Flow?
Load flow refers to the flow of power (active or reactive) from one or more sources through the electrical network to the loads.

Load flow analysis consists of the calculations of the real and active powers flowing in each line and the **magnitude** and the **phase angle** of the voltage at each bus bar for a given transmission system for a specified generation and load conditions.
